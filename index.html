        <h2>What is a Bottle?</h2>
        <p>
            A water bottle is a portable container, usually made of plastic, glass, or metal, used to hold and transport water or other drinks. They're designed for convenience, allowing people to stay hydrated while on the go, whether it's during exercise, travel, or everyday activities. Water bottles can be disposable or reusable, and are often equipped with a lid to prevent spills.
